# Guideline

## environment setup

- npm install
- npx sequelize init
- change config file to credentials and database
- npx sequelize db:create
- npx sequelize db:migrate
- npx sequelize db:seed

## Side notes

- don't mess with model
- setup server and make middleware first
- data relations will be worked on in the afternoon
- database sufficient to make controller for user service and admin finance service
